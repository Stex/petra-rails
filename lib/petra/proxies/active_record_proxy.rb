    # A specialized version of the ObjectProxy class to handle ActiveRecord instances.
    # The main difference is, that changes to an object are only persisted if the
    # records were saved, updated or destroyed using the corresponding
    # methods (save, update_attributes, destroy) as we do not have to track e.g.
    # new records (#new actions) or records which could not be saved due to
    # validation errors etc.
